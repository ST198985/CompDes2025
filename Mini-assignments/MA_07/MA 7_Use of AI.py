Assignment due 02/12/2025

Let’s assume that S is a set of 3d points of a defined spacing in the workspace of the robot.

Using the Virtual Robot plugin in Grasshopper:

In a 3D grid of points

Define the subset S1 of points in S that is reachable by the robot.

Define the subset S2 of points in S where the robot does not collide with itself using axis angles.

Define the subset S3 of points in S that meets the criteria of both S1 and S2, with any additional criteria you see fit.

Define groups and conceptualize idea for Light Sculpture. Prepare initial geometry as a functional robot path for desk crit next week.

Parameters:
Point spacing
Defined axis ranges (min to max)
Modify the definition below or use the definition that we started in class.

Deliverables:

Submission (of GH file) on Github, optionally include a link to your pull request in a Text file as part of your submisson on ILIAS
Upload on ILIAS
Be able to discuss you solution in class
